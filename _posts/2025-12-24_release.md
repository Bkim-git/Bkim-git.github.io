## Release Notes

### 24 December 2025 – [[DfW v1.2]](https://github.com/Bkim-git/DfW-algorithm)

- **Parallelization Redesign**  
  The depth inversion workflow has been fundamentally restructured to support true process-level parallelism.  
  Mode-wise and point-wise depth estimation are now executed in parallel using `joblib`, enabling efficient scaling on multi-core systems.

- **Shared-Memory–Based Data Exchange**  
  Large intermediate arrays (Dynamic Modes and corresponding masks) are no longer copied to each worker process.  
  Instead, they are placed in shared memory and accessed read-only by parallel workers, significantly reducing memory overhead and inter-process communication cost.

- **Deterministic Performance via Thread Control**  
  To avoid nested parallelism and performance instability, BLAS and MKL internal threading are explicitly disabled (single-threaded execution), ensuring reproducible runtime behavior when combined with process-based parallelism.

- **Parallel-Safe Refactoring of Core Routines**  
  Core routines in `modules` have been refactored to be stateless and shared-memory–friendly, enabling safe parallel execution without side effects or race conditions.

### 11 Julu 2025 – [DfW v1.1]

- **Nonlinear wave correction module added** [Kim et al., 2026](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2025.104904) 
  Introduces a dedicated module to account for wave nonlinearity, improving depth inversion accuracy, particularly in shallow water and energetic wave conditions.  

- **Adaptive interrogation windowing implemented** [Kim et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/21664250.2025.2469957) 
  Automatically adjusts the size and shape of the interrogation window to be optimal for bottom slope, wavelength, and wave direction.  

- **Input and configuration handling refined**  
  The input interface has been streamlined by supporting standard video formats (e.g., `*.mov`, `*.mp4`) instead of compressed NumPy archives. Spatial referencing is now decoupled from the video and provided via an external `extent.txt` file (`xmin xmax ymin ymax`), while all runtime parameters have been consolidated into a standalone `config.yaml` file, removing hardcoded dependencies.

- **Visualization and reference data support extended**  
  Visualization capabilities have been enhanced with optional satellite image overlays via `basemap.png`. In addition, ground truth inputs now support both raster-based formats (e.g., GeoTIFF) and point-based formats (e.g., `*.csv`, `*.xyz`), enabling more flexible validation and comparison workflows.


### 24 March 2025 – [DfW v1.0]
- Initial release of the DfW algorithm.
