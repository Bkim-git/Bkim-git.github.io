This is my very first blog post! ðŸ§ 

I'll be sharing insights from my research in coastal engineering, depth inversion using drone-acquired wave video, and wave mode decomposition (e.g., FFT, DMD, EMD). Stay tuned for:

- Fieldwork logs
- Coding tips for image/video-based bathymetry
- Paper updates and preprints
- Conference experiences

Thanks for visiting!
