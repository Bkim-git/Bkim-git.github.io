# 👋 Hello, I'm Byunguk Kim

Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University  
Specializing in coastal wave dynamics, depth inversion, and video-based wave analysis.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Coastal morphodynamics
- Depth inversion using wave dispersion
- Mode decomposition (FFT, DMD, EMD, VMD)
- Signal processing from drone-acquired wave imagery

## 📂 Featured Projects
- **Wave Mode Decomposition Suite**  
  A toolbox to extract significant wave modes using spectral and empirical methods.

- **Nonlinearity-Corrected Depth Inversion**  
  A method to improve shallow-water bathymetry estimates from irregular wave fields.
